#### A Ruby app with Sinatra, Capybara and RSpec

### Version

Ruby version ruby 2.4.0p0, RSpec version 3.6 and Sinatra version 2.0.0s

### Thoughts

I am trying to learn and be better as a junior developer. Right now I am interested in doing a lot of projects using ruby. I will also include here a step by step guide on how I did this small project and all the difficulties I had encountered.

### Work in Progress

I uploaded my work to heroku. I am starting a movement of changing the world one line of code at a time! And I only have me and myself for now. I want to be able to inspire people who have the right mindset to learn but don't have the means to pay for their education. And connect awesome people who can be a mentor to them. Check out this work in progress:
