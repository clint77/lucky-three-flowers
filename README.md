#### A Ruby app with Sinatra, Capybara and RSpec

### Version

Ruby version ruby 2.4.0p0, RSpec version 3.6 and Sinatra version 2.0.0s

### About

This app will take a value for each flower. The input will only allow valid inputs for each. 

  Example: 
    -for Roses it will accept 25 for it can be 2 bundles of 10 and a bundle of 5
    -for Tulips it will accept 17 for it can be 1 bundle of 9, 1 bundle of 5 and 1 bundle of 3.

Then the app will return the least number of bundle for each flower. 

  Example:
    -for Lilies, if the number is 33 it will return 3 bunldes of 9 and 1 bundle of 6 instead of several bundles of 3 or 6.


### Thoughts

I am trying to learn and be better as a junior developer. Right now I am interested in doing a lot of projects using ruby. I will also include here a step by step guide on how I did this small project and all the difficulties I had encountered.

### Work in Progress

I uploaded my work to heroku. I am starting a movement of changing the world one line of code at a time! And I only have me and myself for now. I want to be able to inspire people who have the right mindset to learn but don't have the means to pay for their education. And connect awesome people who can be a mentor to them. Check out this work in progress:

### ToDos

-I would love to be able to make the class more modular
-Refactor the the methods of each class so that it is easy to add or change the bundles
-I would love to have some suggestions on how to make this adhere more to single responsibility principle
